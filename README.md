## Usage

### Basic Examples

Here are some common usage patterns: 

```bash
# Real-time object detection from webcam
hailo-detect --input usb --show-fps

# Process default video file
hailo-detect 

# Use Raspberry Pi camera for pose estimation
hailo-pose --input rpi --frame-rate 30

# Run segmentation without display sync (fastest processing)
hailo-seg --input /path/to/video.mp4 --disable-sync

# Run depth on default video
hailo-depth 
```

### Command Line Interface

After installation, you'll have access to several command-line tools:

#### Main Application Commands

```bash
# Object detection on video file
hailo-detect --input /path/to/video.mp4

# Pose estimation using USB camera
hailo-pose --input usb --show-fps

# Instance segmentation using Raspberry Pi camera
hailo-seg --input rpi

# Depth estimation with custom model
hailo-depth --input /path/to/video.mp4 --hef-path custom_model.hef

# Face recognition
hailo-face-recon --input usb
```

#### Utility Commands

```bash
# Download additional model resources
hailo-download-resources --group default

# Set up environment variables
hailo-set-env

# Run post-installation configuration
hailo-post-install
```



## Configuration

The system uses a YAML configuration file to manage settings. Here's what each configuration option controls:

```yaml
# HailoRT version configuration
hailort_version: "auto"  # Options: "auto", "latest", or specific version (e.g., "4.15.0")

# TAPPAS framework version
tappas_version: "auto"   # TAPPAS model version - "auto" for automatic detection

# Model zoo version for downloading models
model_zoo_version: "v2.14.0"  # Specific version of the Hailo model zoo

# Hardware architecture detection
host_arch: "auto"        # Options: "rpi", "x86", "arm", or "auto"
hailo_arch: "auto"       # Options: "hailo8", "hailo8l", "hailo10h", or "auto"

# File paths and directories
resources_path: "resources"              # Where to store downloaded models
virtual_env_name: "hailo_infra_venv"     # Virtual environment name
storage_dir: "hailo_temp_resources"      # Temporary storage for downloads

# Server configuration
server_url: "http://dev-public.hailo.ai/2025_01"  # Model download server

# TAPPAS configuration
tappas_variant: "auto"           # Options: "tappas", "tappas-core", or "auto"
tappas_postproc_path: "auto"     # Path to post-processing libraries
```

**Configuration Tips:**
- Keep `"auto"` settings for automatic hardware detection
- Only modify `resources_path` if you need models in a specific location
- The `server_url` should not be changed unless directed by Hailo support

## Troubleshooting and Getting Help

If you run into problems, head over to the [Hailo Community Forum](https://community.hailo.ai/) and open a ticket. The forum is packed with helpful information and solutions from other users who've likely faced similar issues.

### Common Issues You Might Encounter

### Frame Buffer Performance Problems
Some models are simply too demanding to run at 30FPS. When this happens, you'll need to dial back the frame rate using the `--set-fps` flag to get smooth performance.

### The Dreaded DEVICE_IN_USE() Error
This error pops up when the Hailo device (typically `/dev/hailo0`) is already being used by another process or got stuck from a previous session that didn't shut down properly.

**Quick Fix:**
The easiest solution is to run our cleanup script:
```bash
../scripts/kill_first_hailo.sh
```

**Manual Fix (For the Curious):**
If you want to understand what's happening under the hood, here's how to troubleshoot it yourself:

1. **Double-check your device path** - Make sure `/dev/hailo0` is actually your Hailo device (it usually is, but worth confirming).

2. **Find the culprit process** - Use this command to see what's hogging your device:
   ```bash
   sudo lsof /dev/hailo0
   ```
   This will show you exactly which processes are using the device and their Process IDs (PIDs).

3. **Kill the blocking process** - Once you have the PID, terminate it with:
   ```bash
   sudo kill -9 <PID>
   ```
   Just replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID from step 2.

That should free up your Hailo device and get you back to running your models smoothly!
