# RTSP Application

#### Run the RTSP example:
```bash
python rtsp.py --input rtsp://username:password@ip_address:port/path
```
To close the application, press Ctrl+C.

This is a simple example of how to use RTSP streams as an input source.

Please note that there is no default demo RTSP source - it is expected that the user provides their own RTSP URL.

The application is based on the detection simple application.

For more details, please see the detection simple application: [Detection simple application](../../apps/detection_simple/README.md)

#### Note: The --input argument must be provided, and only valid RTSP URLs are accepted.
